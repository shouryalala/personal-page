Location based social networking

- Jim is a lateral entry to a new college, doesnt know anyone and is eager to make new friends and connections.
- Sanket is a resident living close to a beautiful heritage site and wants to showcase insightful information and pictures to relevant tourists passing by.
- Alina goes to a nearby community centre and wants to know more about the events that are being organised today.
- Tushar's family is affected by COVID and would like to find out which of his local hospitals currently has oxygen cylinders available.

Although attempted several times in the past, there are compelling upsides to the formation of online location based communities. 


Primary features of this network:
- geographic units: anyone presently in that geographic perimeter has access to the entire feed. ![[walkthrough-a.gif]]

-  Community generated: The 'periferis' or the perimeters of each community is decided based on how many upvotes a certain user request receives and whether a periferi already exists. 
	- eg: A new periferi request is created by Ashwin for a periferi around his Hostel Block. If no significatly overlapping periferi already exists and more than 100 people approve the request, the periferi gets created.![[walkthrough-c.gif]]

- Recognized periferis: Periferis/networks for a town/state/city/recognised establishments will already be available. If you are in multiple periferis based on your location, an intuitive pinch out/pinch in motion will land you in the periferi of your choice.

This allows a user to decide the expanse of the information that they would like to consume and  how intimate they would like to be with their interactions. A user would interect differently with their local neighbourhood as compared to posting on a feed available to the entire country.

This potentially leads to a very well-differentiated network. At a local level, it might be consumed as a ready-to-go group chat with neighbours. In a wider area, it might be consumed as a bulltein board for important information for that locality. At a further larger level, it might act as a community aggregated news platform delivering relevant ongoings and happenings in their city.

This stands to be the core idea. A POC for this was built, and gained great reception at a college level. Can be expanded to have many more features and address many more important points at commercial scale:
- a way to pin non-protected periferis so you can interect and view that feed even if you arent present there geogrphically.
- A way for community selected moderators to control who can post in certain periferis.
- Customised capabilities in certain periferis to certain actors: businesses, local authorities, and so on
- The feed algorithm, privacy, sensitive content, and the other 1800 things that come up with building for the masses

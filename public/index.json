[{"categories":["Idea"],"contents":"Till date, most of India\u0026rsquo;s grocery retail happens at small local stores (kiranas), accounting for 75-78% of the consumer goods market.\nMost of these local stores only track their inventory on a batch level and do not digitize their day-to-day sales. That means that close to 75-78% of a $883 billion market is offline. This leads to challenges.\nDownsides Shopowners need to be concious of their inventory and purchase stock based on what sells and what doesnt. This is usually done through intuition. Shopowners cant calculate their EOD profits. They can only calculate their net sales for the day via cash received + the deposits settled in their bank. Brands have a pronounced problem. They would like to understand a bit more about which hyperlocal regions or pincodes are the best selling for them. They\u0026rsquo;d also like to position their inventory ahead of their competitors, as with a lot of fmcg products, visibility is king. Brands would also like to host targetted campaigns based on perceived interests. But they dont gain a granular understanding of specific markets. More of an aggregated understanding based on the goods sold to higher level distributors. Roadblocks Big shopping stores and retail outlets tend to have item scanners and a desktop setup with a local/cloud software for billing and invoicing. This is usually a luxury for kirana stores.\nSolution A CV model trained on various FMCG products with a client facing app posing as an enhanced \u0026lsquo;item scanner\u0026rsquo;\nProduct level: User comes in, picks up items and approaches the billing counter. The billing equipment is nothing but a smartphone on a stand. Shopkeeper scans the items one-by-one within seconds by pointing it at the app opened camera. The app compiles the list of items and generates the bill based on pre-set prices for each item. Quantity of items will also be perceived by the app and duly factored in. Each subtotal would be editable in case some changes are required based on customer requests or current offers. Transaction is stored. User shares mobile number at their discretion in case they want a copy of the receipt as an SMS. POC Attempted a simple POC using transfer learning over an existing open dataset made available by Stanford research (link here) Model can be trained and refined on different verticals based on categories of items sold. This will improve accuracy and keep manual intervention to a minimum If core solution is accepted, this can further foray into becoming a SaaS, linked to other stakeholders like distributors or brands, extending this service into automated invetory fulfillment, store offers, credit-line etc. Notes/Caveats Requires the model accuracy to be strong and needs to be accomodative to new items being added to it Requires the interaction medium to be text-light and action-light. Most kirana store owners are technologically unsavvy individuals who will approach this with low inclination. Requires a library of items to be maintened and prices fluctuate based on time and region A lot of misc things to be thought about. Some shops sell various kinds of dal for example. Model will be able to capture the item but not the sub category. Stores tend to sell loose condiments too. Or off-brand items. Or season based items Monetization - Target audience is specifically price sensitive ","permalink":"https://shourya.io/shourya/personal-page/blog/retail-pos/","tags":["Computer Vision","Idea","Product","SaaS"],"title":"Retail POS"},{"categories":["Android And Gaming"],"contents":"Location based social networking\nJim is a lateral entry to a new college, doesnt know anyone and is eager to make new friends and connections.

But his latest project had proved to be a lot more demanding than he had ever expected.\nThis time, he was tasked with crafting an extremely pivotal clue, one that would bring the lower-order beings even closer to the acceptance. This was the fourth phase of a six phase story arc. Having played crucial roles in constructing the clues for the third phase, the pressure on him was higher than ever to deliver a great piece.\nMax was a man of few words, preferring to let his work speak for itself. He spent countless hours in his office, pouring over code and designs, making sure every detail was perfect. This time he had chosen to hide the next clue in the discovery of a new particle, that he had playfully nicknamed the God particle. The project had consumed him, and he found himself working longer and longer hours, barely taking breaks to eat or sleep.\nAs weeks turned to months, the spotlight and awe around the project continued to grow, especially amongst his co-workers. People would whisper about him in the cafeteria in hushed tones, as if they were afraid to be overheard. When he walked into a room, conversations would stop abruptly, and everyone would turn to stare at him, avoiding asking him any direct questions.\nOne constant that centred him through all of this was Alicia. She was the only person that Max had grown close to in many years. Different people had adjusted in different ways to the events of the recent times. The world had grown increasingly solitary and she remained the only person who knew how to make Max open up. Lately, the project had been keeping them from frequently meeting each other.\nOne night, Max was working late in his office, working on the anthropomorphic variables that were crucial for the sim-phase-4 discovery. He was so absorbed in his work that he didn’t notice the door opening slowly behind him. It wasn’t until he heard footsteps approaching that he turned around.\nStanding in the doorway was Elliott, the CEO \u0026amp; President of Hypernova. He was tall and imposing, with a constant stern expression on his face. Max felt a cold sweat break out on his forehead as the man stepped into the room.\n\u0026ldquo;Max\u0026rdquo;, Elliott said, his voice low and menacing. \u0026ldquo;How close are we?\u0026rdquo;\nMax tried to compose himself, but he was taken aback to see Elliott and didn’t answer for several seconds. Elliott walked over to Max\u0026rsquo;s workspace, his eyes scanning the frameworks on his desk.\n\u0026ldquo;Looks like sim-phase-4 is shaping out to be quite interesting\u0026rdquo;, he said, his voice barely above a whisper. \u0026ldquo;What are your plans for the spacetime coordinates?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Planning to place it in sim-2012, in Switzerland\u0026rdquo;, Max replies.\nElliott gives an approving nod, his grim face slowly turning in an expression of assurance. He walked around the workspace as he took in more of the data.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re reaching closer to letting them find out about us. Its an exciting time.\u0026rdquo; He says from the other side of the desk.\nMax attempts to engage Elliott on the topic. \u0026ldquo;What do you think will happen when they do?\u0026rdquo;\nHe looks at Max and replies after a few seconds. \u0026ldquo;Same thing that happened to us, hopefully\u0026rdquo;. He gives him a rare comforting smile and starts to walk back out of the room.\nBefore leaving, he stops for a moment and turns back. \u0026ldquo;You know you should take a break from time to time. Do you have any plans after work?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes sir, I do. Going out with Alicia today to the phase-6 museum.\u0026rdquo;\n","permalink":"https://shourya.io/shourya/personal-page/blog/onion-world/","tags":["Photos","Game","React","Python","New"],"title":"Onion World"},{"categories":["Android And Gaming"],"contents":"Heading 1 Heading 2 Heading 3 Heading 4 Heading 5 Heading 6 Emphasis Emphasis, aka italics, with asterisks or underscores.\nStrong emphasis, aka bold, with asterisks or underscores.\nCombined emphasis with asterisks and underscores.\nStrikethrough uses two tildes.

But his latest project had proved to be a lot more demanding than he had ever expected.</p><p>This time, he was tasked with crafting an extremely pivotal clue, one that would bring the lower-order beings even closer to the acceptance. This was the fourth phase of a six phase story arc. Having played crucial roles in constructing the clues for the third phase, the pressure on him was higher than ever to deliver a great piece.</p><p>Max was a man of few words, preferring to let his work speak for itself. He spent countless hours in his office, pouring over code and designs, making sure every detail was perfect. This time he had chosen to hide the next clue in the discovery of a new particle, that he had playfully nicknamed the God particle. The project had consumed him, and he found himself working longer and longer hours, barely taking breaks to eat or sleep.</p><p>As weeks turned to months, the spotlight and awe around the project continued to grow, especially amongst his co-workers. People would whisper about him in the cafeteria in hushed tones, as if they were afraid to be overheard. When he walked into a room, conversations would stop abruptly, and everyone would turn to stare at him, avoiding asking him any direct questions.</p><p>One constant that centred him through all of this was Alicia. She was the only person that Max had grown close to in many years. Different people had adjusted in different ways to the events of the recent times. The world had grown increasingly solitary and she remained the only person who knew how to make Max open up. Lately, the project had been keeping them from frequently meeting each other.</p><p>One night, Max was working late in his office, working on the anthropomorphic variables that were crucial for the sim-phase-4 discovery. He was so absorbed in his work that he didn’t notice the door opening slowly behind him. It wasn’t until he heard footsteps approaching that he turned around.</p><p>Standing in the doorway was Elliott, the CEO & President of Hypernova. He was tall and imposing, with a constant stern expression on his face. Max felt a cold sweat break out on his forehead as the man stepped into the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Max&rdquo;, Elliott said, his voice low and menacing. &ldquo;How close are we?&rdquo;</p><p>Max tried to compose himself, but he was taken aback to see Elliott and didn’t answer for several seconds. Elliott walked over to Max&rsquo;s workspace, his eyes scanning the frameworks on his desk.</p><p>&ldquo;Looks like sim-phase-4 is shaping out to be quite interesting&rdquo;, he said, his voice barely above a whisper. &ldquo;What are your plans for the spacetime coordinates?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Planning to place it in sim-2012, in Switzerland&rdquo;, Max replies.</p><p>Elliott gives an approving nod, his grim face slowly turning in an expression of assurance. He walked around the workspace as he took in more of the data.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re reaching closer to letting them find out about us. Its an exciting time.&rdquo; He says from the other side of the desk.</p><p>Max attempts to engage Elliott on the topic. &ldquo;What do you think will happen when they do?&rdquo;</p><p>He looks at Max and replies after a few seconds. &ldquo;Same thing that happened to us, hopefully&rdquo;. He gives him a rare comforting smile and starts to walk back out of the room.</p><p>Before leaving, he stops for a moment and turns back. &ldquo;You know you should take a break from time to time. Do you have any plans after work?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes sir, I do. Going out with Alicia today to the phase-6 museum.&rdquo;</p></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=text-capitalize><div class=container><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-12 border-top py-4 text-center"><div class=row><div class=col-3>Shourya Lala © 2023</div><div class=col-6></div><div class=col-3><a href=https://twitter.com/atShourya target=_blank>@atShourya</a></div></div></div></div></div></footer><script>var indexURL="https://shourya.io/shourya/personal-page/index.json"</script><script src=https://shourya.io/shourya/personal-page/plugins/jQuery/jquery.min.js></script>
